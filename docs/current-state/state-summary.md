# Current State Summary

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** March 22, 2026  
**Owner:** HLLMR LLC  
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Doc Status Tag:** Implemented

## Scope

This file summarizes where Conset PDF stands now, what is complete, and what is next.

## Current Baseline

- Phase 0 foundation is treated as complete for its intended scope.
- Documentation governance baseline is implemented:
  - authority order defined,
  - mandatory status tags enforced,
  - non-authoritative claim rule established.
- Canonical entry points are explicitly listed in the documentation index.

## Complete Now

- Cargo workspace and crate structure are present.
- IR, extraction, engine, and audit crates exist and are wired in the workspace.
- Foundational test suites exist across core crates.
- Phase A governance policy is active and tagged across docs.
- Phase B: current-state library hardened with evidence-linked assertions.
- Phase C: full repo doc triage complete — deprecated v3 merge-target docs retired; merge-target count = 0 (see `../DOC_GOVERNANCE.md` canonical phase closure snapshot).
- Phase D: selective postmortem migration complete — M-001 through M-015 (including d-ext cycle), SLM-001 through SLM-010 all closed; migrated constraints are reflected in canonical docs (see `../DOC_GOVERNANCE.md` and `../ARCHITECTURE.md`).
- Phase E: Gap Register complete — 10 gaps enumerated (G-001–G-010), 4 CRITICAL gaps identified on the PDF→IR critical path. See `gap-register.md`.
- Phase F: Alignment Audit complete — capability-matrix updated to reflect actual code state; critical stubs and missing wiring documented with canonical source mismatches; R-005 raised.

## Next Focus

- Close G-001/G-004/G-005 critical chain: implement `PdfiumExtractor::extract_page()`, wire PDF text→IR span conversion, and implement `Extractor::extract()` to produce a real LayoutTranscript from a PDF file.
- Close G-002: implement `Processor::process()` with coordinate normalization and validate_transcript call.
- Close G-003: implement CLI argument parsing in `main.rs` to orchestrate the full pipeline.
- Close G-009: replace manual transcript construction in end-to-end test with real PDF fixture invocation.
- Continue Phase D Extension: mine remaining algorithm contracts (ID parsing thresholds, merge planning modes, ROI detection rules) into an `AEC_ALGORITHMS.md` canonical doc.

## Evidence-Linked Assertions

- Governance model implemented: see `../DOC_GOVERNANCE.md` and `../DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Phase 0 accepted baseline: see `../dev/PHASE_0_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_v4_2_1.md` and `../MASTER_PLAN.md`.
- Crate foundation present: see `../../crates/ir/`, `../../crates/engine/`, `../../crates/pdf-extraction/`, `../../crates/audit/`.

## Evidence Pointers

- Master plan: ../MASTER_PLAN.md
- Architecture: ../ARCHITECTURE.md
- Standards: ../DEV_STANDARDS.md
- Governance: ../DOC_GOVERNANCE.md
- Phase 0 plan: ../dev/PHASE_0_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_v4_2_1.md
